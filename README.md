# Turkey-Left-Palestine
Primary sources on the history of Turkey's Left and Palestine

This repository contains a number of primary sources, primarely books and press articles, that might be useful to those who are interested in studying the history of the radical left in Turkey and its linkages and intellectual connections with the Palestinian organizations during the Cold War. 

Material included in the repository comes largely from research I conducted in 2019-2020, while writing my MA thesis at Leiden University. It was collected through the archive of the International Institute of Social History (in Amsterdam), and the the online collections of the Türkiye Sosyal Tarih Araştırma Vakfı, the library of Sabancı University, and a couple of raids in bookstores and second-hand bookstores (in Istanbul). 

Most of the press sources included are useful if approaching the topic in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The "Books and Memoirs" file, instead, extends to the late 1970s.

While the repository includes many sources, it does not claim to be complete or free from error. If you find mistakes in it, or want to tell me about a source that should be a part of it, feel free to contact me!
